# NSA Codebreaker 2022 Write-Ups

This repository holds my four write-ups for the 2022 challenge.

While I started the challenge back in September 22, I could not commit time to it and resumed trying to solve in early December, only giving me a little more than a week which was unfortunate.

I was the only student at the University of Portland to compete in the challenge, scoring 161.00 points.

<b><u>I am currently stuying for finals, so there are no write-ups as of 12/11/22. I will write them up post finals.</b></u>
