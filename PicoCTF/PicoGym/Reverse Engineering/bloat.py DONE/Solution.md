To complete this problem, you can see that in the bloat.flag.py file, there a return True at the top.
Copy and paste the a[] list into a new python file, and then copy and paste the series of a[]+a[]
that lend to the return True.

Print out that value, and you recieve the flag:
picoCTF{d30bfu5c4710n_f7w_5e14b257}
