# CTF Writeups

Welcome to my CTF writeups repository! This repository contains writeups for various Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges that I have participated in. Each competition has its own directory within this repository, organized by the challenge names.

## Competitions List

- [Hackappatoi CTF 2022](./Hackappatoi%20CTF%202022/)
- [NSA Codebreaker 2022](./NSA%20Codebreaker%202022/)

- [Space Heroes 2023](./Space%20Heroes%202023/)


## Usage

Feel free to explore the different CTF competition directories to find writeups for the challenges I have completed. Each challenge directory typically contains the following:

- **README.md**: A detailed writeup explaining the challenge, its objectives, and the steps taken to solve it.
- **Source code**: If available, the source code or binary files related to the challenge.
- **Assets**: Any additional assets used during the analysis or exploitation of the challenge.
- **Flag**: If the challenge required finding a flag, it will be included in the writeup.

## Disclaimer

These writeups are meant to share knowledge and techniques used in CTF challenges. However, please remember that CTF challenges often have time-limited validity and are designed to be learning experiences. Sharing detailed solutions publicly can spoil the challenges for others. Use these writeups responsibly and consider participating in live CTF events to get the full experience.
