To solve this problem, I took the KeygenMe.class file, and imported it into Ghidra. After analyzing the file,
I find that it has two functions. I copied the larger function that has all of the decompiled code. From here,
we can see that the code is checking every single char space, looking for the flag in reverse order. We can get the
flag by just starting at the bottom, and working our way up, building up the flag, which gives us:

picoCTF{700l1ng_r3qu1r3d_2bfe1a0d}
